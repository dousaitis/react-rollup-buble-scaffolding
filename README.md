# react-rollup-buble-scaffolding
This is a scaffolding app with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/) and [Bubl√©](https://buble.surge.sh/guide/). It also compiles [scss](http://sass-lang.com/) to css. If you run it on *development mode* the [livereload](http://livereload.com/) plugin refreshes your browser on any file change. If you run the *production build* you can see the **file size** of the **minified** bundle. 

## Installation
